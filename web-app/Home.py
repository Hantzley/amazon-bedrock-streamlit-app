    Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) \
    from leading AI companies like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Stability AI, and Amazon with a single API, \
    along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications, simplifying development \
    while maintaining privacy and security. With the comprehensive capabilities of Amazon Bedrock, you can easily \
    experiment with a variety of top FMs, privately customize them with your data using techniques such as \
    fine-tuning and retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and create managed agents that execute complex business \
    tasks‚Äîfrom booking travel and processing insurance claims to creating ad campaigns and managing inventory‚Äîall \
    without writing any code. Since Amazon Bedrock is serverless, you don't have to manage any infrastructure, and \
    you can securely integrate and deploy generative AI capabilities into your applications using the AWS services \
    you are already familiar with.
